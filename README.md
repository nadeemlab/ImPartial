Segmenting noisy multiplex spatial tissue images is a challenging task, since the characteristics of both the noise and 
the biology being imaged differs significantly across tissues and modalities; this is compounded by the high monetary 
and time costs associated with manual annotations. It is therefore important to create algorithms that can accurately 
segment the noisy images based on a small number of annotations. *With **ImPartial**, we have developed an algorithm to 
perform segmentation using as few as 2-3 training images with some user-provided scribbles. ImPartial augments the 
segmentation objective via self-supervised multi-channel quantized imputation, meaning that each class of the 
segmentation objective can be characterized by a mixture of distributions. This is based on the observation that perfect 
pixel-wise reconstruction or denoising of the image is not needed for accurate segmentation, and hence a self-supervised 
classification objective that better aligns with the overall segmentation goal suffices. We demonstrate the superior 
performance of our approach for a variety of datasets acquired with different highly-multiplexed imaging platform.*

## Pipeline

![figure1_workflow](./images/figure1_workflow_novariance.png)
*(A) Overview of the ImPartial pipeline. (B) Each image patch is separated into an imputation patch and a blind spot 
patch. The blind spot patch is fed through the U-Net to recover the component mixture and the component statistics. The 
latter statistics are averaged across the entire patch to enforce component consistency. Both the component statistics 
and component mixture are used to compute the mixture loss for the patch. Simultaneously, a scribble containing a small 
number of ground truth segmentations for the patch is used to compute the scribble loss. Both losses propagate gradients 
back to the U-Net architecture on the backward pass.*

## ImageJ/Fiji Plugin

Pre-requisites
* [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads)
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) 
  (or use [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/maven) on macOS)

First, package the plugin. From the repo root directory
```shell
cd imagej-plugin
mvn clean package
```
and copy the `.jar` file into Fiji's plugins directory. For example, if you're using macOS
```shell
cp target/impartial_imagej-0.1.jar /Applications/Fiji.app/plugins
```

then restart **Fiji** and open `ImPartial` from the `Plugins` menu bar.

This repository provides a training and testing pipeline using the ImPartial framework.

## Datasets

| Dataset  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `MIBI`  | 4  2-channel mibi images, segmentation classes: cytoplasm, nuclei in cytoplasm, nuclei out of cytoplasm  |
| `Vectra`  | 8  2-channel Vectra images, segmentation classes: cytoplasm, nuclei in cytoplasm, nuclei out of cytoplasm  |
| `TissueNet`  | https://datasets.deepcell.org/  |
| `Cellpose`  | https://www.cellpose.org/  |

## Data Preparation and Preprocessing

### Steps
* Create dataset for ImPartial training
* Select training images split into train, val, test sets
* Use preprocessing files to generate input .npz files
* If ground truth labels are available:
  * Use automated skeltonization on ground truth labels to generate scribbles .npz files
* If NO ground truth labels:
  * Create scribbles using [Deepcell label](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-label) or other annotation tools such as ImageJ

  
### Code

There are two notebooks for preparing and processing a dataset. 

* Prepare_dataset.ipynb
	1. Load the dataset
	2. Select the images you want to use (save_list)
	3. Select the images from (save_list) to be used in training (train_list). Remaining images to be used in test.
	4. Set (savedir) path to save .npz files.
	5. Create `files.csv` which contains names (prefix) and path (input_dir) of train and test images (group)

* Preprocessing.ipynb (Automated scribble generation of training image from ground truth labels)
	1. Read files.csv
	2. Get number of instances per segmentation class
	3. Define number of scribbles for labels
	4. Define percentage validation region (val_perc = 0.4)
	5. Scribbles .npz file is saved in the input_dir path defined in pd_files (files.csv)
	6. Scribbles .csv file is also saved (contains parameters related to scribbles)
	
## Training 

Create the following dataset-specific training configuration in `main_impartial.py`:
```
n_channels = number of input image channels
classification_tasks = a python dict of tasks and corresponding number of classes, recunstruction channels
```

```python
    if cparser.dataset == 'Deepcell':
        scribble_fname = 'files_2tasks_10images_scribble_train_' + cparser.scribbles + '.csv'
        files_scribbles = os.path.join(data_dir, scribble_fname)
        pd_files_scribbles = pd.read_csv(files_scribbles) #scribbles

        n_channels = 2
        classification_tasks = {'0': {'classes': 1, 'rec_channels': [0,1], 'ncomponents': [2, 2]},
                                '1': {'classes': 1, 'rec_channels': [0], 'ncomponents': [1, 2]}}
```

	
* Select/adjust training parameters 
  * Set input file paths in (impartial_bash.sh) file
  ```
    data_dir = "path to data directory containg .npz files"
	data_dir = '/user/data/impartial/' # example
  ```
  * Set output file paths in (impartial_bash.sh) file
  ```
    basedir_root = " path to output files "
	basedir_root = "/user/experiments/deepcell/models/" # example
  ```
  * Set dataset name
  * Set mcdropout, checkpoint ensembles, no. of epochs etc. 
	
	
* Training output is represented as .pickle file
  ```
  - output is a dictionary with tasks as keys (in case of 2 tasks [0,1], in case of 1 task [0])
  - each output[task] is a dictionary with:
	- 'class_segmentation': np.array size = (batch x nclasses x h x w) 
	- 'class_segmentation_variance': np.array size = (batch x nclasses x h x w)
  ```
